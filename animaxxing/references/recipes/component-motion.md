# Recipe: component motion

A full-screen menu, an interruptible entrance with a different exit, native `<dialog>` enter and exit, an accordion panel, a sliding tab indicator, and a button that shows loading, success, and failure. The app keeps its markup, styling, and state (`aria-expanded`, `inert`, the focus trap, `hidden`, `open`, `aria-selected`); builders only move inline styles between states the app has chosen, and teardown restores them.

Lifecycle: the framework controller creates each builder once the component is mounted, calls `open`, `close`, or `moveTo` when app state changes, and `revert` on unmount. Partial setup rolls back per [effect restoration](../effect-restoration.md).

Dependencies: `gsap`.

## menuOverlay

A full-screen panel wipes in from one edge, then its links stagger in; closing reverses from wherever the open reached. At rest the panel is `visibility: hidden`, so its links leave the tab order and accessibility tree; the wipe is a `clip-path` inset, so the panel never moves.

The app owns the trigger's `aria-expanded`, `inert` on the rest of the page, the focus trap, and Escape. It calls `open()` after setting that state and focuses into the panel on completion. To close, it returns focus to the trigger first, then calls `close()`: each exiting link turns `visibility: hidden` and would drop focus to `<body>`. Keep the panel laid out, never `display: none` or `hidden`.

```css
.menu { position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: 40; visibility: hidden; }
```

```ts
export type MenuOverlayOptions = {
  /** Selector, within the panel, for the items that stagger in. */
  links?: string;
  /** The edge the panel wipes in from. */
  from?: Edge;
  duration?: number;
  stagger?: number;
};

export type MenuOverlay = {
  /** Wipes the panel in, then staggers the links. Move focus inside when it completes. */
  open(): gsap.core.Timeline;
  /** Links out, then the wipe back, from wherever the open is. Return focus to the trigger when it completes. */
  close(): gsap.core.Timeline;
  revert: Teardown;
};

const LINK_Y = 16;

export function menuOverlay(
  panel: HTMLElement,
  { links = "a", from = "top", duration = 0.5, stagger = 0.05 }: MenuOverlayOptions = {},
): MenuOverlay {
  const run = relay();
  /** Percent of the panel still clipped, on the edge opposite `from`. Tweened as a number so a computed clip never has to be parsed. */
  const clip = { inset: 100 };
  const insets: Record<Edge, () => string> = {
    top: () => `inset(0% 0% ${clip.inset}% 0%)`,
    bottom: () => `inset(${clip.inset}% 0% 0% 0%)`,
    left: () => `inset(0% ${clip.inset}% 0% 0%)`,
    right: () => `inset(0% 0% 0% ${clip.inset}%)`,
  };
  const paint = () => {
    panel.style.clipPath = insets[from]();
  };
  let items: HTMLElement[] = [];
  const revert = own((dispose, after) => {
    after(snapshotStyles([panel], ["visibility", "clip-path"]));
    dispose(run.kill);
    gsap.set(panel, { visibility: "hidden" });
    paint();
    items = Array.from(panel.querySelectorAll<HTMLElement>(links));
    after(snapshotStyles(items, ["opacity", "visibility", "transform", "translate"]));
    gsap.set(items, { autoAlpha: 0, y: LINK_Y });
  });
  return {

      if (prefersReducedMotion()) return tl.set(clip, { inset: 0, onUpdate: paint }).set(items, { autoAlpha: 1, y: 0 });

        .to(clip, { inset: 0, duration, ease: "power3.inOut", onUpdate: paint })
        .to(items, { autoAlpha: 1, y: 0, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.out", stagger }, "-=0.2");
    },
    close() {
      const tl = run.next();
      if (prefersReducedMotion()) {
        return tl.set(items, { autoAlpha: 0, y: LINK_Y }).set(clip, { inset: 100, onUpdate: paint }).set(panel, { visibility: "hidden" });
      }
      return tl
        .to(items, { autoAlpha: 0, y: LINK_Y, duration: 0.2, ease: "power2.in", stagger: { each: stagger / 2, from: "end" } })
        .to(clip, { inset: 100, duration: duration * 0.8, ease: "power3.inOut", onUpdate: paint }, "-=0.1")
        .set(panel, { visibility: "hidden" });
    },
    revert,
  };
}
```

Links become focusable as each arrives; put a close control that must work at once outside the `links` selector.

`menuOverlay` rebuilds a timeline per call, so its close always retraces the open. For an exit that differs from the entrance, use `enterExit`.

## enterExit

One timeline holds a different entrance and exit, split by a pause: `open()` plays the entrance to the pause and `close()` plays on into the exit. Interruptions stay continuous. Closing mid-entrance reverses it, and reopening mid-exit reverses back to the open rest. With GSAP 3.15+, `easeReverse` sets the reversal's own ease, so a `back.out` entrance can retreat on a quick `power3.in`. Without it, a reversed tween runs its ease backwards, and overshoot eases turn sluggish.

The caller writes both halves. The entrance uses `fromTo` from the closed state, including `autoAlpha: 0` on the container, so time 0 is closed. The exit uses `to`, starting from the open rest. After the exit finishes, the playhead returns to 0 and the next `open()` replays the entrance. The builder skips `overwrite`: a reused timeline must own its targets, because an overwrite would kill its tweens for good. The app owns state and focus, as with `menuOverlay`.

```ts
export type EnterExitOptions = {
  /** Reverse ease for every tween in both halves; GSAP 3.15+. Leave unset on older GSAP. */
  easeReverse?: string | boolean;
  /** Speed of a reversed entrance. Above 1 gets out of the way faster. */
  reverseSpeed?: number;
  /** Called at the open rest, including a reopen that reversed out of the exit. */
  onOpen?: () => void;
  /** Called at the closed rest, from a reversed entrance or a finished exit. */
  onClose?: () => void;
};

export type EnterExitPhase = "closed" | "opening" | "open" | "closing";

export type EnterExit = {
  /** Plays the entrance, or turns an exit in flight back to the open rest. */
  open(): void;
  /** Plays the exit from the open rest, or reverses an entrance in flight. */
  close(): void;
  phase(): EnterExitPhase;
  revert: Teardown;
};

export function enterExit(
  enter: (tl: gsap.core.Timeline) => void,
  exit: (tl: gsap.core.Timeline) => void,
  { easeReverse, reverseSpeed = 1.5, onOpen, onClose }: EnterExitOptions = {},
): EnterExit {
  let tl: gsap.core.Timeline | undefined;

  let phase: EnterExitPhase = "closed";
  const opened = () => {
    phase = "open";

    tl?.timeScale(1);
    onClose?.();
  };

      defaults: easeReverse === undefined ? {} : { easeReverse },
      // A finished exit rewinds to the entrance's closed start, without firing callbacks.
      onComplete: () => {
        timeline.pause(0);
        closed();
      },
      onReverseComplete: closed,
    });
    tl = timeline;
    enter(timeline);
    openAt = timeline.duration();
    // Fires in both directions: forward at the end of the entrance, backward when a reopen reverses the exit.
    timeline.addPause(openAt, () => void (phase === "open" || opened()));
    exit(timeline);
    // Paint the closed state now: before GSAP's first tick, a context defers the entrance's immediate render a frame.
    timeline.render(0, true, true);
  });
  const reduced = (to: number, done: () => void) => {
    tl?.pause(to);
    done();
  };
  return {
    open() {
      if (!tl || phase === "open" || phase === "opening") return;
      if (prefersReducedMotion()) return reduced(openAt, opened);
      if (phase === "closed") tl.timeScale(1).play(0);
      // Closing: an entrance being reversed plays forward again; an exit reverses to the pause.
      else if (tl.time() < openAt) tl.timeScale(1).play();
      else tl.timeScale(1).reverse();
      phase = "opening";
    },
    close() {
      if (!tl || phase === "closed" || phase === "closing") return;
      if (prefersReducedMotion()) return reduced(0, closed);
      if (phase === "open") tl.timeScale(1).play();
      // Opening: an entrance reverses at `reverseSpeed`; a reopen from the exit plays on into it.
      else if (tl.time() < openAt) tl.timeScale(reverseSpeed).reverse();
      else tl.timeScale(1).play();
      phase = "closing";
    },
    phase: () => phase,
    revert,
  };
}
```

```ts
// Example: a menu whose links spring in and tumble out.
const panel = document.querySelector<HTMLElement>(".menu")!;
const items = panel.querySelectorAll<HTMLElement>("a");
const menu = enterExit(
  (tl) =>
    tl
      .fromTo(panel, { autoAlpha: 0 }, { autoAlpha: 1, duration: 0.2 })
      .fromTo(items, { autoAlpha: 0, y: 24 }, { autoAlpha: 1, y: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "back.out(2)", stagger: 0.05 }, "<0.1"),
  (tl) =>
    tl
      .to(items, { y: () => window.innerHeight, rotation: () => gsap.utils.random(-30, 30), duration: 0.6, ease: "power2.in", stagger: 0.03 })
      .to(panel, { autoAlpha: 0, duration: 0.2 }, "-=0.2"),
  { easeReverse: "power3.in", onClose: () => toggle.focus() },
);
```

- Values are recorded on first play. Function-based values, such as the random rotations above, are drawn once. Revert and rebuild to re-roll them or to re-measure after a resize.
- Under reduced motion, `open()` and `close()` jump to the pause or to 0 and still call `onOpen` and `onClose`.
- A reversed entrance never plays its exit; reserve an exit-only cue, such as a sound, for the full close.

## dialogMotion

`open()` calls `showModal()`, fades the backdrop, and scales the panel in (or slides it from an edge for a drawer). `close(returnValue)` runs the exit, then `dialog.close(returnValue)`, so `returnValue`, the `close` event, and native focus return behave as usual. Escape's `cancel` runs the exit instead of closing instantly. GSAP cannot reach `::backdrop`, so the builder tweens `--dialog-backdrop` on the dialog for the CSS to read; `::backdrop` inherits it in current browsers.

```css
dialog::backdrop { background: rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5); opacity: var(--dialog-backdrop, 1); }
/* A drawer: the app positions it; the builder only slides it. */
dialog.drawer { margin: 0 0 0 auto; height: 100%; max-height: none; }
```

```ts
export type DialogPlacement = "center" | Edge;
export type DialogMotionOptions = {
  /** `center` scales in; an edge slides the dialog in from that side. */
  placement?: DialogPlacement;
  duration?: number;
};

export type DialogMotion = {
  /** Calls `showModal()` unless already open, then animates the backdrop and panel in. */
  open(): gsap.core.Timeline;
  /** Animates out, then calls `dialog.close(returnValue)`. */
  close(returnValue?: string): gsap.core.Timeline;
  revert: Teardown;
};

const DIALOG_PROPS = ["opacity", "transform", "translate", "--dialog-backdrop"];
const ONSTAGE = { opacity: 1, x: 0, y: 0, xPercent: 0, yPercent: 0, scale: 1, "--dialog-backdrop": 1 };
const OFFSTAGE: Record<DialogPlacement, gsap.TweenVars> = {
  center: { scale: 0.96, y: 8 },
  top: { yPercent: -100 },
  bottom: { yPercent: 100 },
  left: { xPercent: -100 },
  right: { xPercent: 100 },
};

export function dialogMotion(dialog: HTMLDialogElement, { placement = "center", duration = 0.3 }: DialogMotionOptions = {}): DialogMotion {
  const run = relay();
  const hidden = { opacity: 0, "--dialog-backdrop": 0 };
  const exit = placement === "center" ? { scale: 0.98 } : OFFSTAGE[placement];
  let rest = () => {};
  const close = (returnValue?: string) => {
    const tl = run.next();
    if (!dialog.open) return tl;
    const finish = () => {
      if (dialog.open) dialog.close(returnValue);
    };
    if (prefersReducedMotion()) return tl.call(finish);
    return tl.to(dialog, { ...hidden, ...exit, duration: duration * 0.7, ease: "power2.in" }).call(finish);
  };
  const revert = own((dispose, after) => {
    rest = snapshotStyles([dialog], DIALOG_PROPS);
    after(rest);
    dispose(run.kill);
    // Browsers let a page cancel Escape once per user activation; an uncancelable
    // cancel closes at once and the close listener below still tidies up.
    listen(dispose, dialog, "cancel", (event) => {
      if (!event.cancelable) return;
      event.preventDefault();
      close();
    });
    // Every close, animated or not, ends at the dialog's own styles. The event is a
    // task after close(); a reopen already in flight by then keeps its start state.
    listen(dispose, dialog, "close", () => {
      if (dialog.open) return;
      run.kill();
      rest();
    });
  });
  return {
    open() {
      const tl = run.next();
      if (!dialog.open) {
        // Hidden before its first paint; focus still lands inside because opacity keeps the contents focusable.
        gsap.set(dialog, { ...hidden, ...OFFSTAGE[placement] });
        dialog.showModal();
      }
      if (prefersReducedMotion()) return tl.set(dialog, ONSTAGE);
      return tl.to(dialog, { ...ONSTAGE, duration, ease: "power3.out" });
    },
    close,
    revert,
  };
}
```

A direct close (a `<form method="dialog">` submit, the app's own `dialog.close()`) is instant and still ends clean; route it through `close(value)` to animate. `revert` never closes the dialog; the app owns `open`.

## disclosure

An accordion panel grows from 0 to its content height and back: the one sanctioned layout tween. Rules: one panel per builder; the end height is measured at call time (`height: "auto"`); `overflow: hidden` clips while moving and while closed; once open, the inline height and overflow clear so content can reflow. A server-rendered inline `height: 0` is dropped at open rest, never restored. Siblings move only because layout moves them.

The app owns the trigger's `aria-expanded` and the panel's `hidden`: show the panel, then `open()`; `close()`, then apply `hidden` on completion so closed content leaves the tab order. A panel not rendered at build is collapsed inline, so unhiding it paints nothing until `open()`. Panel padding shows at height 0; pad an inner element. Give the panel `display: flow-root`, or first and last child margins jump at both ends of the tween.

```ts
export type DisclosureOptions = { duration?: number; ease?: string };

export type Disclosure = {
  /** After the app shows the panel: grows from the current height to the content height, then clears the inline height. */
  open(): gsap.core.Timeline;
  /** Collapses to 0 and leaves `height: 0; overflow: hidden` inline. Apply `hidden` when it completes. */
  close(): gsap.core.Timeline;
  revert: Teardown;
};

const COLLAPSED = { height: 0, overflow: "hidden" };

export function disclosure(panel: HTMLElement, { duration = 0.3, ease = "power2.inOut" }: DisclosureOptions = {}): Disclosure {
  const run = relay();
  const saved = { height: panel.style.height, overflow: panel.style.overflow };
  /** Open rest: content-sized. The app's own values come back, except a pre-collapsed pair from the server. */
  const settleOpen = () => {
    const collapsed = saved.height !== "" && parseFloat(saved.height) === 0;
    gsap.set(panel, { clearProps: "height,overflow" });
    if (saved.height && !collapsed) panel.style.height = saved.height;
    if (saved.overflow && !collapsed) panel.style.overflow = saved.overflow;
  };
  const revert = own((dispose, after) => {
    after(snapshotStyles([panel], ["height", "overflow"]));
    dispose(run.kill);
    // Hidden, or inside a closed <details>: collapse now so showing it reveals nothing early.
    const rendered = panel.checkVisibility ? panel.checkVisibility() : panel.getClientRects().length > 0;
    if (!rendered) gsap.set(panel, COLLAPSED);
  });
  return {
    open() {
      const tl = run.next();
      if (prefersReducedMotion()) return tl.call(settleOpen);
      // The sanctioned layout tween: "auto" measures the content when the tween starts.
      return tl.set(panel, { overflow: "hidden" }).to(panel, { height: "auto", duration, ease }).call(settleOpen);
    },
    close() {
      const tl = run.next();
      if (prefersReducedMotion()) return tl.set(panel, COLLAPSED);
      return tl.set(panel, { overflow: "hidden" }).to(panel, { height: 0, duration, ease });
    },
    revert,
  };
}
```

With `<details>`, wrap the content after `<summary>` in one panel element and keep its own `open` state: prevent the summary's default, set `open` before `open()`, and clear it when `close()` completes (see Wiring). Skip this where CSS already animates `::details-content`.

## tabIndicator

An underline or pill slides onto the selected tab with `x` and `scaleX` from its own resting box, so its CSS keeps color, thickness, and radius. Physical measurement handles RTL. A `ResizeObserver` on the list and tabs re-fits it when widths change.

The app owns `aria-selected`, the roving `tabindex`, and arrow keys, and calls `moveTo(tab)` when selection changes (or on focus, for focus-activated tabs). At build the indicator sits under the `aria-selected="true"` tab, if any.

```css
.tablist { position: relative; }
.tab-indicator { position: absolute; inset-inline-start: 0; bottom: 0; width: 40px; height: 2px; background: currentColor; }
```

```ts
export type TabIndicatorOptions = { duration?: number; ease?: string };

export type TabIndicator = {
  /** Slides and resizes the indicator onto `tab`. Call it when the selected tab changes. */
  moveTo(tab: HTMLElement): gsap.core.Timeline;
  revert: Teardown;
};

export function tabIndicator(
  indicator: HTMLElement,
  tablist: HTMLElement,
  { duration = 0.3, ease = "power3.out" }: TabIndicatorOptions = {},
): TabIndicator {
  const run = relay();
  let active: HTMLElement | undefined;
  let sliding = false;
  /** Transforms from the indicator's resting box onto the tab's, in viewport coordinates. */
  const fit = (tab: HTMLElement) => {
    const box = indicator.getBoundingClientRect();
    const target = tab.getBoundingClientRect();
    // With the origin at the left edge, only x moves that edge and only scaleX changes the width.
    const left = box.left - Number(gsap.getProperty(indicator, "x"));
    const width = box.width / Number(gsap.getProperty(indicator, "scaleX"));
    return { x: target.left - left, scaleX: target.width / width };
  };
  const revert = own((dispose, after) => {
    after(snapshotStyles([indicator], ["transform", "translate", "transform-origin"]));
    dispose(run.kill);
    gsap.set(indicator, { transformOrigin: "0% 50%" });
    active = tablist.querySelector<HTMLElement>('[aria-selected="true"]') ?? undefined;
    if (active) gsap.set(indicator, fit(active));
    let primed = false;
    const resize = new ResizeObserver(() => {
      // The first delivery only reports initial sizes; the indicator is already placed.
      if (!primed) {
        primed = true;
        return;
      }
      if (!active) return;
      // A tab that changes size as it becomes selected, such as a bolder label, must not cut the slide short: retarget it.
      if (sliding) slide(active);
      else run.next().set(indicator, fit(active));
    });
    resize.observe(tablist);
    tablist.querySelectorAll<HTMLElement>('[role="tab"]').forEach((tab) => resize.observe(tab));
    dispose(() => resize.disconnect());
  });
  /** Tweens from wherever the indicator is onto `tab`. */
  function slide(tab: HTMLElement): gsap.core.Timeline {
    active = tab;
    const tl = run.next();
    if (prefersReducedMotion()) return tl.set(indicator, fit(tab));
    sliding = true;
    return tl.to(indicator, { ...fit(tab), duration, ease, onComplete: () => void (sliding = false) });
  }
  return {
    moveTo: slide,
    revert,
  };
}
```

Revert before the tabs change and rebuild after the new ones render; the observer only knows tabs present at build.

## stateButton

A button that shows its work: pressed, its label lifts away and a spinner turns while the app waits; on success the spinner finishes its turn before a check draws itself; on failure the button shakes and the label comes back. Then it settles to its label. The button never changes size: the label stays in place to hold its width, at `opacity: 0`, while the icons sit over it.

The app owns the request and calls the builder's methods as it goes. The builder sets `aria-busy` while loading and announces the result through a visually hidden status beside the button, since a check or a shake says nothing to a screen reader.

```html
<button class="send" type="submit"><span data-state-label>Send</span></button>
```

```ts
export type StateButtonOptions = {
  /** The text that lifts away. Defaults to `[data-state-label]` inside the button. */
  label?: HTMLElement;
  /** Seconds the check or the error holds before the label returns. */
  hold?: number;
  /** Seconds per spinner turn. */
  turn?: number;
};
export type StateButton = {
  loading(): gsap.core.Timeline;
  /** Finishes the spin, draws the check, announces `message`, then returns to the label. */
  success(message?: string): gsap.core.Timeline;
  /** Stops the spin, shakes, announces `message`, and returns to the label. */
  error(message?: string): gsap.core.Timeline;
  /** Straight back to the label. */
  reset(): gsap.core.Timeline;
  revert: Teardown;
};

The check's stroke is drawn by its dash offset, with no plugin. The spinner turns only while loading and stops on success, error, reset, or revert; it never runs ambient. Under reduced motion nothing spins, draws, or shakes: the label swaps out and back, and the status still announces the result.

## Controller contract

| Builder | Create | Returns | Reduced motion |
|---|---|---|---|
| `menuOverlay` | Settled, once the panel is laid out | `{ open, close, revert }` | Panel and links appear or vanish whole; both timelines complete |
| `enterExit` | Settled, once the targets are laid out; rebuild after a resize that changes measured values | `{ open, close, phase, revert }` | Jumps to the open or closed rest; `onOpen` and `onClose` still fire |
| `dialogMotion` | Settled, once per `<dialog>` | `{ open, close, revert }` | `open()` shows at once; `close()` closes on the next tick |
| `disclosure` | Settled, once per panel | `{ open, close, revert }` | Height snaps; inline height still clears once open |
| `tabIndicator` | Settled, once tab widths are final | `{ moveTo, revert }` | Jumps onto the tab |
| `stateButton` | Settled, once the button is mounted; call `loading`, `success`, `error`, or `reset` as the request runs | `{ loading, success, error, reset, revert }` | Label swaps at once, nothing spins or shakes; the status still announces |

- State first, motion second, in the same task: set `aria-expanded`, `inert`, `hidden`, or `open`, then call the builder. Hang the closing state change on the returned timeline's `onComplete`, or `enterExit`'s `onClose`; every timeline completes, under reduced motion too.
- `open()` and `close()` may interrupt each other; the next call tweens from where things are. Nothing here navigates, changes attributes, or moves focus, except `dialogMotion`'s `showModal()` and `close()`.
- A menu in the persistent shell belongs to the shell's controller, not a page's GSAP context; a context reverted at unmount would strip its rest styles.
- Revert before the panel, dialog, or tabs are removed from the DOM.
