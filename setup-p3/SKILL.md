# Setup p3

Write `p3-models.md`, a file that sets p3-stack's model per role. Default location is the current project root. Offer `~/.agents/p3-models.md` as the global option, and ask which one. A project file wins over the global one.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Call `orchestrator_capabilities`. It lists the providers and models you can pass to `delegate_task` in this session, custom models included, with each one's provider instance ID and any reasoning options. That is the only source. If it returns nothing, stop and tell the user. Never write a provider or model it did not return. `inherit-parent` is always valid even though it is not a detected model.

### 2. Load current state

The roles are the labels shown in step 5. If `p3-models.md` already exists at the chosen location, read it and treat its `# budget` line and its role values as the current choices. Otherwise start from the defaults in step 3(b). A line whose role is not in step 5, such as `how critics`, is from a retired role. Drop it.

### 3. Budget, map, and confirm

**(a) Ask for a budget.** Ask plainly in the thread. Offer these four options with these exact labels, and name the current budget when the file records one.

- `unlimited — keep max`
- `large — xhigh reasoning`
- `medium — high reasoning`
- `small — medium reasoning`

**(b) Apply it.** Build the working table. On a fresh run, give code roles (`feature, refactoring`, `bug-fix`, `perf-issue`, `hillclimb`) and the explorer, investigator, and swarm roles the fastest strong coding model detected. Give `judgment and prose`, `hardest tasks`, the explainer, the synthesizers, and `reflect tooling` the most capable model detected. Fill each panel role with one entry per distinct provider detected, up to three. On a re-run, keep any role the user changed.

When the catalog exposes reasoning options for a model, set each real entry's effort option from the budget: `unlimited` takes the highest option, and `large`, `medium`, and `small` take `xhigh`, `high`, or `medium`. The ladder is `max` > `xhigh` > `high` > `medium` > `low`. If the model does not expose the target, use the highest option at or below it, else mark the role as needing a choice. `inherit-parent` does not change. When the catalog exposes no reasoning options, map roles only and drop effort tokens; the budget label is still recorded.

**(c) Show the roles and confirm.** Show every role with its model, marking any entry not in the detected set as needing a choice. Also list each line step 2 dropped. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` (the role runs on the parent thread's model, so omit the model in `delegate_task`) as the options. For panel roles (arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one `delegate_task` runs per entry, `inherit-parent` entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it whose provider differs from the parent's when possible. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

### 4. Validate

Every real entry written must be in the `orchestrator_capabilities` result, under the provider instance it came from. `inherit-parent` always passes. If a chosen entry is not available, stop and ask again.

### 5. Write the file

Write `p3-models.md` with a `# budget` line with the chosen label and its target effort, and one line per role, using the same labels p3-mode uses. Write each entry as `<providerInstanceId>/<model>`, followed by its effort option in parentheses when step 3(b) set one. Overwrite the whole file so re-runs stay idempotent. Shape:

```
# p3 model configuration. One line per role. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default.
# `inherit-parent` as a value: the role runs on the parent thread's model (omit the delegate_task model). Entries in a panel list still count toward its fan-out.
# budget: unlimited (max)
feature, refactoring: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
bug-fix: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
perf-issue: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
hillclimb: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
judgment and prose: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
hardest tasks: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
how explorer: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
how explainer: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
why investigators: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
why synthesizer: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
reflect tooling: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
arena runners: <entry>, <entry>, <entry>
arena cross-judge pool: <entry>, <entry>, <entry>
swarm workers: <providerInstanceId>/<model> (<effort>)
architect runners: <entry>, <entry>, <entry>
interrogate reviewers: <entry>, <entry>, <entry>
```

### 6. Confirm

Tell the user the file was written, where, and that it applies to new sessions. Re-running this skill updates it.

### 7. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with /create-verification-skill." On yes, invoke `/create-verification-skill`. On no, move on without pushing.
